#### How it Works

There are multiple components in our app, and you maybe want to customize their look and feel. The `ThemeProvider` have a property called `globalConfig` that allows you to set global configuration for all components.

You can set properties like `styling` to change the default styling of components, or `input` to set specific configurations for each Input component.
